# TTSWAP Constant Value Formula vs Uniswap Constant Product Formula: An In-Depth Comparison of Two Trading Mechanisms

## Formula Comparison Overview

### 📊 TTSWAP Constant Value Formula

$$
\begin{align}
    {V_a\over Q_a}*Δa={V_b\over Q_b}*Δb&=...={V_z\over Q_z}*Δz  \\  
    Total\ value\ before\ the\ trade&(V_a+V_b+....+V_z)  \\
    =Total\ value\ &after\ the\ trade(V_a+V_b+....+V_z)  \\
\end{align}
$$

### 🦄 Uniswap Constant Product Formula
```
x × y = k (Constant Product)
Where: x = Token A amount, y = Token B amount, k = constant
```

## Perspective 1: Design Philosophy Comparison

### 🎯 **TTSWAP Constant Value Formula: Value Balance Based**
- **Core Idea:** The "trading intensity" of all tokens must be equal
- **Focus:** Market value and trading fairness
- **Best For:** Multi-token pools, complex trading scenarios

### 🎯 **Uniswap Constant Product Formula: Quantity Product Based**
- **Core Idea:** The product of the two token amounts remains constant
- **Focus:** Simple and direct supply-demand relationship
- **Best For:** Dual-token pools, simple and efficient trading

## Perspective 2: Real Trade Example Comparison

Let's use the same initial conditions to compare both formulas:

### 📝 **Initial State**
- ETH pool: 100 ETH, market price $2,000/ETH (total value $200,000)
- USDC pool: 200,000 USDC, market price $1/USDC (total value $200,000)

### Scenario: A user wants to swap 10 ETH for USDC

---

## 🔍 **TTSWAP Constant Value Formula Calculation**

**Step 1: Calculate the trading intensity on the ETH side**
- V_ETH = $200,000 (ETH pool total value)
- Q_ETH = 100 (ETH pool amount)
- Δ_ETH = 10 (ETH to sell)
- ETH trading intensity = (200,000 ÷ 100) × 10 = 20,000

**Step 2: Calculate USDC based on the balance principle**
- V_USDC = $200,000 (USDC pool total value)
- Q_USDC = 200,000 (USDC pool amount)
- Balance condition: (200,000 ÷ 200,000) × Δ_USDC = 20,000
- Required USDC = 20,000

**Trade result: 10 ETH → 20,000 USDC**

---

## 🦄 **Uniswap Constant Product Formula Calculation**

**Constant product principle:**
- Before trade: 100 ETH × 200,000 USDC = 20,000,000
- After trade: (100+10) ETH × (200,000-?) USDC = 20,000,000

**Calculation:**
- 110 × (200,000 - USDC out) = 20,000,000
- 200,000 - USDC out = 20,000,000 ÷ 110 ≈ 181,818
- USDC out = 200,000 - 181,818 = 18,182

**Trade result: 10 ETH → 18,182 USDC**

## Perspective 3: Result Difference Analysis

### 📊 **Data Comparison**
| Aspect | General AMM Formula | Uniswap Formula | Difference |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|
| USDC Received | 20,000 | 18,182 | +1,818 |
| Actual Rate | 1 ETH = 2,000 USDC | 1 ETH = 1,818 USDC | General AMM is better |
| Slippage | 0% | 9.1% | No slippage in General AMM |

### 🤔 **Why the Difference?**

**TTSWAP Constant Value Formula Features:**
- Trades based on **current market value**
- Truly reflects the value of each token
- Keeps trading intensity equal for all tokens
- **No slippage for sub-orders**

**Uniswap Features:**
- Adjusts price automatically based on **supply-demand curve**
- Cannot reflect the value of each token
- Large trades cause significant slippage
- **Price discovery mechanism** is built into the formula

## Perspective 4: Liquidity Enhancement Strategy Comparison

### 🌊 **Uniswap: Virtual Liquidity Enhancement**

**What is virtual liquidity?**
- Uses algorithms to simulate a deeper liquidity pool
- Provides a better trading experience with limited capital
- Like putting a "magnifying glass" on a small pond to make it look like a lake

**Example:**
```
Real pool: 50 ETH + 100,000 USDC
Virtual effect: behaves like 100 ETH + 200,000 USDC
Result: less slippage, better user experience
```

### 🌊 **TTSWAP Constant Value: Liquidity Aggregation**

**What is liquidity aggregation?**
- Integrates multiple separate dual-token pools into a single multi-token pool
- All tokens share the same liquidity pool
- Like connecting several small reservoirs into one large system

**Example:**
```
Traditional way:
ETH-USDC pool + USDC-DAI pool + DAI-USDT pool (3 separate pools)

General AMM way:
ETH-USDC-DAI-USDT (1 unified pool)
Any two tokens can be traded directly, sharing all liquidity
```

## Perspective 5: In-Depth Pros and Cons Comparison

### 📊 **Liquidity Utilization Efficiency Comparison**
**Scenario: User wants to swap ETH for DAI**

**Uniswap constant product path (requires hops):**
1. ETH → USDC (using ETH-USDC pool)
2. USDC → DAI (using USDC-DAI pool)
- Requires two trades, two times slippage
- Liquidity is split, efficiency is low

**TTSWAP constant value path (direct trade):**
1. ETH → DAI (directly in the unified pool)
- One trade completes it
- All liquidity is integrated, minimal slippage

### 💡 **Liquidity Depth Example**

Suppose the market has:
- ETH-USDC pool: $10 million
- USDC-DAI pool: $8 million
- DAI-USDT pool: $6 million
- ETH-USDT pool: $8 million

**Uniswap mode:**
- ETH to DAI can only use the first two pools
- Effective liquidity ≈ $8 million (limited by the smaller pool)

**General AMM mode:**
- ETH to DAI can use all pools' liquidity
- Effective liquidity ≈ $14 million (all integrated)

## Perspective 6: In-Depth Pros and Cons Comparison

## Summary: Comparison of Two Liquidity Enhancement Strategies

### 🔮 **Technical Route Comparison**

**Uniswap's "Virtual Amplification" Strategy:**
- Like putting a magnifying glass on a small pond
- Uses algorithms to maximize limited capital
- Best for capital-constrained but experience-focused scenarios

**TTSWAP's "Integration and Aggregation" Strategy:**
- Like merging several reservoirs into a lake
- Achieves real depth by integrating fragmented liquidity
- Best for optimal trade execution

### 🌟 **Complementarity of the Two Mechanisms**

These two formulas actually represent different directions in AMM development:

1. **Uniswap Constant Product:** Optimizes within the existing architecture (virtual liquidity)
2. **TTSWAP Constant Value Model:** Redesigns the architecture for fundamental improvement (liquidity aggregation)

### 🎯 **Advice for Regular Users**
According to the comparison, it's more recommended to trade on TTSWAP. (Currently, there are airdrop rewards on TTSWAP)
**Choose General AMM when:**
- Doing regular trades
- Wanting better price execution
- Doing complex multi-asset trades
- Care about trading costs and slippage
- Want lower gas costs

**Core Difference Summary:**
- **Uniswap:** Makes a small pool look like a big pool (virtual enhancement)
- **General AMM:** Actually merges small pools into a big pool (real integration)

Both mechanisms have their value. Understanding their differences helps you make smarter choices in the DeFi world. As technology evolves, we may see more hybrid solutions combining the best of both.
