# **Still Providing Liquidity on Normal Dex? Switch to TTSwap for Better Returns and Lower Costs!**

## üíÄ The Hidden Pitfalls of  - How Many Do You Know?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Invisible Fees - You're Not Earning What You Think**

A Dex's latest ** X protocol** routes large volumes of **small price fluctuation orders** to aggregators for matching, and these transactions' fees **no longer get distributed to LPs (Liquidity Providers)**.
In other words: you think you're earning fees, but they're actually flying past you.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Regular Users vs Pro Traders - Returns Differ by Dozens of Times**

On Normal, professional traders know how to adjust "price ranges" to maximize returns.
As a regular user, you simply don't have time to monitor charts daily and adjust ranges. The result: **providing the same liquidity, pros earn dozens of times more, while you barely break even.**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Capital Erosion Risk - This is Real**

Don't forget the infamous "impermanent loss" problem. During volatile market conditions, LPs on Normal Dex can easily experience "the more you provide, the less you have" situations. **If you can't protect your principal, what's the point of earning returns?**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Exorbitant Gas Fees - You're Losing Money Before You Start**

Deploy, adjust, exit ‚Äî **every step burns gas**, and what you earn isn't enough to cover transaction fees. Especially during network congestion, **a single operation can cost dozens of dollars.**
