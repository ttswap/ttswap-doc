### ‚ùì 7. Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: üìâ What if the token price never rises?**  
A: The team's interests are strongly correlated with token price, not misaligned with token holders' interests. All tokens remain locked, giving the team incentive to drive project success.

**Q: üîì What can unlocked tokens be used for?**  
A: They can be freely traded, used for voting, staked, or invested.

**Q: üïµÔ∏è Can this mechanism be manipulated?**  
A: No, all allocation and unlock records are publicly available on-chain and transparent.

**Q: ü§î Why do unlock ratios increase from (Founder > Partners > Value Contributors > Capital Contributors)?**
A: The design principle is to bind core project members more closely to long-term project value. As the project grows, more core roles receive greater benefits.

**Q: ‚è∞ Why not use the common time-based unlocking?**  
A: Time-based unlocking allows teams to unlock and sell even without achieving results, harming ordinary token holders' interests and being unfair to regular holders.

TTS token adopts an innovative goal-oriented deflationary model, ensuring token value is tightly bound to project development through price-based unlock mechanisms and community profit burns. Through differentiated unlock rules, it incentivizes different roles to contribute to the ecosystem, achieving multi-party win-win outcomes.
