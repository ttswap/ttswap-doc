## I. What is Role-Based Revenue Sharing? 🤔

TTSWAP employs an innovative "Role-Based Revenue Sharing" mechanism that distributes platform trading fees based on participants' different roles and contributions within the ecosystem. This mechanism ensures that every participant contributing to the platform receives corresponding benefits, truly realizing the fair principle of "who participates, who benefits; who benefits, who promotes."

## II. Six Roles and Their Benefits 👥

### 1. 💧 Liquidity Providers (50%~80%)
- **Role Definition**: Users who provide trading liquidity to the platform
- **Revenue Sources**: Trading fee share + TTS mining rewards
- **Example**: Xiao Ming deposits ETH worth 1,000 USDT into the liquidity pool, accounting for 10% of the pool's total value. When the pool generates 1,000 USDT in fees, Xiao Ming receives 100 USDT as his share. Additionally, he participates in protocol liquidity mining to earn TTS tokens.

### 2. 🔌 Service Providers/Gateways (5%~25%)
- **Role Definition**: Service providers offering technical interfaces, wallet integrations, and investment gateways for TTSWAP
- **Revenue Sources**: Share of trading fees generated through their channels
- **Example**: A wallet app integrates TTSWAP, and its users complete a 1,000 USDT transaction through the wallet, generating 10 USDT in fees. The wallet receives 2.5 USDT as its share.

### 3. 👥 Referrers (5%~10%)
- **Role Definition**: Promoters who successfully refer new users to TTSWAP
- **Revenue Sources**: Share of trading fees generated by referred users
- **Example**: Xiao Hong refers Xiao Zhang to use TTSWAP. When Xiao Zhang completes a 1,000 USDT transaction, generating 10 USDT in fees, Xiao Hong receives 1 USDT as a referral reward.

### 4. 👤 Users Themselves (10% Discount)
- **Role Definition**: Users who trade on TTSWAP
- **Revenue Sources**: Trading fee discounts
- **Example**: Xiao Li trades 1,000 USDT on TTSWAP. Instead of paying 10 USDT in fees, he only pays 9 USDT.

### 5. 🎮 Token Administrators (1%~3%)
- **Role Definition**: Managers responsible for token listing, parameter settings, and operations
- **Revenue Sources**: Share of trading fees generated by their token
- **Example**: A token administrator manages ABC token. When ABC token generates 1,000 USDT in trading fees, the administrator receives 20 USDT as their share.

### 6. 🌐 Community and Protocol (1%~7%)
- **Purpose**: Used for buyback/burn/development funds, etc.
- **Example**: The platform uses part of the fees to buy back and burn TTS tokens, increasing token value.
