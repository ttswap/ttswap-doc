        icon: 💧
        details: You no longer need to establish trading pairs one by one, nor worry about "pool too small, insufficient liquidity". TTSWAP allows all trading pairs to share a super pool for the same token, making trading faster and smoother.

        title: No Principal Loss, LPs Feel More Secure
        icon: 🌐
        details: On other platforms, when you provide liquidity, you easily lose money due to price fluctuations, which is called principal loss, also known as "impermanent loss". TTSWAP's mechanism can effectively avoid this problem, and your investment won't decrease.

## Constant Value Trading Protocol Introduction

$$
\text{Value before commodity exchange} = \text{Value after commodity exchange} \\
$$
>The reason for exchange is the mismatch between quantity and value, automatically matched through market mechanisms

### 🔹 Step 1: Definition Introduction
Let:
* $V_a$: Current total value of Token A (unit: e.g., USD)
* $Q_a$: Current total quantity of Token A
* $V_b$, $Q_b$: Total value and quantity of Token B
* $Δa$: Quantity of A that the user wants to invest
* $ΔV$: Value transferred in this exchange (from A to B)
* $Δb$: Quantity of B exchanged from the pool based on value transfer

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Formula Under Equal Value Conditions

$$
Δb = \frac{Q_b}{Q_a + Δa} \cdot  Δa
$$
>Split commodity b according to the quantity of a, then exchange Δa portions

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Derivation of Exchange Formula Under Unequal Value Conditions

$$
ΔV = \frac{V_a}{Q_a + {{Δa}\over 2}} \cdot Δa \\
$$
$$
Δb = \frac{Q_b}{V_b + {{ΔV}\over 2}} \cdot ΔV \\
$$

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Update Token A and B Values and Quantities After Trading

|    | Token A          | Token B          |
| -- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Value | $V_a$ | $V_b$ |
| Quantity | $Q_a + Δa$ | $Q_b - Δb$ |

---

### 🔹 Step 5: New Exchange Ratio After Trading

* After trading completion, new marginal values:

$$
P_a^{\text{new}} = \frac{V_a}{Q_a + Δa}
\quad , \quad
P_b^{\text{new}} = \frac{V_b}{Q_b - Δb}
$$

* New exchange ratio:

$$
R_{a \to b} = \frac{P_a^{\text{new}}}{P_b^{\text{new}}}
$$
