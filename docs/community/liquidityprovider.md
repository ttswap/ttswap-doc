## üõ°Ô∏è **How Do We Achieve "Zero Impermanent Loss"?**

Traditional DEXs use the constant product formula (x*y=k), where asset ratios change with price fluctuations, causing impermanent loss. TTSwap eliminates this problem fundamentally through our innovative **Constant Value Balance Mechanism**.

**Your principal, our protection.**

## üöÄ **Revolutionary Breakthrough: Liquidity Amplification + Concentrated Liquidity Technology**

### **Traditional Model:**
- 1x liquidity = 1x fee revenue
- Low capital utilization with revenue ceiling

### **TTSwap Innovation:**

**Technical Principles:**
- **Concentrated Liquidity Technology** pools all liquidity into a single pool, maximizing pool utilization
- **Liquidity Amplification Technology** enables one unit of liquidity to generate multiple returns

**Real-World Impact:**
- Provide ETH and earn trading fees from ALL token pairs trading against ETH
- Capital efficiency improved by 300%-500%, achieving **1x principal, multiple returns**

## üìä **Yield Comparison: TTSwap vs. Traditional DEX**

| Revenue Source | Traditional DEX (e.g., U**swap) | **TTSwap** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trading Fee Share** | ~70% fee distribution | **50%-80%** fee distribution |
| **Impermanent Loss** | **Exists, can erode most profits** | **Zero impermanent loss** |
| **Additional Mining** | None | **TTS secondary mining rewards** |
| **Principal Safety** | Market volatility risk | **Protected by innovative mechanism** |

## üöÄ **Yield Simulation (Example: 5,000 USDT with 2x amplification providing 10,000 equivalent liquidity, representing 1/1000 of total market liquidity)**

Assuming annual trading volume/liquidity ratio = 10, TTS price = 0.05 USDT.

| Revenue Source | Annual Yield Calculation | Annual Yield (USDT) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Trading Fees (70% share)** | 10,000 * 10 * 0.3% * 70% | 210 |
| **TTS Secondary Mining (estimated)** | (200M) * 0.02 / 1000 | 400 |
| **Total Annual Yield** | **210 + 400** | **610** |
| **Annual Percentage Yield** | **610 / 5,000** | **12.2%** |

*Note: Actual yields vary with trading volume, staking duration, and TTS price. This is a conservative estimate; data suggests some pools may achieve 10%+ APY.*
